# Bank Management System in Java

This repository contains the code for a console-based Bank Management System developed in Java. The application allows users to perform various banking operations, including opening accounts, displaying account details, depositing money, and withdrawing funds.

## Features
The Bank Management System offers the following features:

- **Account Management**: Users can open new accounts by providing account details such as account number, account type, name, and initial balance.
- **Account Information**: Users can view the details of all existing accounts, including the account holder's name, account number, account type, and current balance.
- **Deposit**: Users can deposit a specified amount into a selected account.
- **Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw a specified amount from a chosen account, provided the account has sufficient balance.
- **Account Search**: Users can search for specific accounts using the account number and display their details.

## Usage
To run the Bank Management System, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.

2. Compile the Java source file `BankingApp.java` by running the following command:
   
   javac BankingApp.java
   

3. Execute the compiled Java program by running the following command:
   
   java BankingApp
   

4. Follow the instructions displayed on the console to interact with the application and perform different banking operations.

## Future Enhancements
While the current version of the Bank Management System is functional, there are several possible improvements and additional features that could be implemented, including:

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Enhance the application with a GUI to improve user experience and make it more visually appealing.
- **Database Integration**: Integrate a database system to store account details persistently.
- **Transaction History**: Implement a transaction history feature to track and display a log of account transactions.
- **User Authentication**: Add a secure login system to authenticate users and protect sensitive account information.
